# Linguistic Fieldwork Extension Tools (LFET)

The **Linguistic Fieldwork Extension Tools (LFET)** project is a community-driven hub for developing high-utility, cross-platform tools designed to support and streamline the work of linguistic fieldworkers.

The goal of this repository is to bridge functional gaps between popular linguistic software applications like [**FLEx**](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/), [**ELAN**](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), [**SayMore**](https://software.sil.org/saymore/), [**Dekereke**](https://casali.canil.ca/Dekereke/), and [**Phonology Assistant**](https://software.sil.org/phonologyassistant/), by providing lightweight, dedicated utilities for data collection, conversion, and crowdsourcing.

## üöÄ Ready Tools

| Tool Name | Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Video Annotation Tool](https://github.com/rulingAnts/videoannotationtool/)** | `rulingAnts/videoannotationtool` | A desktop tool for easily recording video-prompted data (e.g., Max Planck kits). **Exports immediately ready for ELAN/SayMore (single WAV + click-separated entries).** | Python 3.11, Tkinter, Pydub |
| **[FLEx Interlinear Copy Assistant](https://github.com/rulingAnts/flex-interlinear-copy)** | `rulingAnts/flex-interlinear-copy` | Streamlines conversion of Tab-Separated Value (TSV) interlinear text from FLEx/spreadsheets into publication-ready **LaTeX**, **XLingPaper XML**, and **HTML**. | Python, Tkinter, Pyperclip, XML, CSV |
| **[Native-Speaker Excel Transcription/Back-Translation Tool](https://github.com/rulingAnts/FlexText-Excel-Import)** | `rulingAnts/FlexText-Excel-Import` | Facilitates text collection by allowing native speakers to transcribe and back-translate using an Excel template. **Converts Excel data to FLEx-ready FlexText.** | Python 3.8+, openpyxl, lxml |


## üí° Planned Tools (Roadmap)
